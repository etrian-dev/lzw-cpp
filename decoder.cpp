        /* DECODER LOGIC -> https://marknelson.us/posts/2011/11/08/lzw-revisited.html
        * The important thing is to understand the logic behind the decoder. 
        * When the encoder encounters a string that isnâ€™t in the dictionary, 
        * it breaks it into two pieces: a root string and an appended character. 
        * It outputs the code for the root string, and adds 
        * the root string + appended character to the dictionary.
        * It then starts building a new string that starts with the appended character.
        * 
        * So every time the decoder accesses the dictionary with a code, 
        * it knows that the first character in that string was the appended character 
        * of the string just added to the dictionary by the encoder (dict[code][0]).
        * And the root of the string added to the dictionary? That was the previously decoded string,
        * because the decoder is one step behind the encoder.
